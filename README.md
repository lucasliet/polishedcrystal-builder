polishedcrystal is a project of [@Rangi42](https://github.com/Rangi42)

this repo was only to automate builds from its beta branch https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal/ since they weren`t publishing releases from it yet, so you don´t have to compile from source code

> ℹ️ this project is currently disabled and serves only as archived previously beta releases since the previously 9bit branch was already merged into master branch and release as 3.1.1 and dev on official repo

you can download the latest release here https://github.com/lucasliet/polishedcrystal-builder/releases, this project now works only as archived previous releases, if something break on the official repo

any instructions you may need, please read the original source from Rangi42's repo on beta branch

there's also a beta test channel on their [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ZK5pqK8)

there is a trigger that checks everyday for a new commit and build a new release at morning if so
