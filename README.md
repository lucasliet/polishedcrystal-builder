# Polished Crystal 9bit auto builder

polishedcrystal is a project of [@Rangi42](https://github.com/Rangi42)

this repo is only to automate builds from its beta 9bit branch https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal/tree/9bit

since they are not publishing releases from it yet, so you donÂ´t have to compile from source code

you can download the latest release here https://github.com/lucasliet/polishedcrystal-builder/releases/latest

any instructions you may need, please read the original source from Rangi42's repo on 9bit branch

there's also a 9bit test channel on their [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ZK5pqK8)

EDIT: i've made a trigger to run a new release [every friday at 7am](https://github.com/lucasliet/polishedcrystal-builder/blob/ab87799a0ef3cc69b0c7e59941e4b3fe57a4da6b/.github/workflows/nightly.yml#L12) if there's a new commit on 9bit branch
