  NIGHTLY_BODY: |
    <p>This is the current Polished Crystal dev rolling release. The assets all have an 8-character "commit hash" at the end to identify the exact code they're built from.</p>

    <p>The <b>.gbc</b> assets are ROMs. If you just want to play the game, download one (regular, <code>-faithful</code> which omits some non-canon changes, or <code>noir</code> which is in grayscale) and load it in <a href="https://bgb.bircd.org/">BGB</a>, <a href="https://mgba.io/">mGBA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sinamas/gambatte">Gambatte</a>, or another accurate Game Boy Color emulator. (<i><b>Do not use VBA</i></b> or VBA-M.) If your emulator or flashcart has issues with supporting a real time clock (or you desire it disabled for any other reason), download your preferred version with the <code>-nortc</code> flag.</p>

    <p>The <b>.sym</b> assets are "symbol files". They're useful for debugging, or for <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Discovering-GameShark-cheat-codes">discovering cheat codes</a>, although cheats are <i><b>not</b></i> officially supported and may cause bugs or crashes. (Do <i><b>not</b></i> ask the developers for cheat codes.)</p>

    <p>The <b>.patch</b> assets are 3DS Virtual Console patches to enable trading and battling over Wi-Fi. You can bundle the .gbc and corresponding .patch into a playable .cia file using <a href="https://github.com/vulcandth/poke-cia">poke-cia</a>.</p>

    <p>The <b>.bsp</b> asset is a <a href="https://github.com/aaaaaa123456789/bsp">BSP</a> save file patch in case you need to upgrade a save file from an older 3.1.0 beta build, using a patcher like the one for <a href="http://pokemonprism.com/patcher.html">Pokémon Prism</a>.</p>

    <p>The <b>polisheddebug</b> assets are ROMs and symbol files with extra features to help debug the game. Do <i><b>not</b></i> download these to just play with; use them to help the developers diagnose and fix bugs, or create new features.</p>
